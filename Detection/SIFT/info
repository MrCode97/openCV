Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)

That is an algorithm to detect and features in an Image. The description of local features are (mostly) invariant against translation, rotation and scaling.
Also are they robust against diffrent lighting-scenes, (image-) noise and little geometrical deformations.

Note: This algorithm is US-patented by University of British Columbia. To my knowledge you should be free to use it within the EU because there is no EU counterpart.
But I guess for privat-use they won't care anyway.
