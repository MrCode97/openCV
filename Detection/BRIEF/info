Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features - BRIEF

BRIEF is a feature descriptor -> it doesn't provide any method to find the features! So you will have to use any other feature detectors like SIFT, SURF etc.
The paper recommends to use CenSurE-detector (called "STAR"-detector in openCV) which is a fast detector and BRIEF works even slightly better for CenSurE points than for SURF points.
In short, BRIEF is a faster method feature descriptor calculation and matching. It also provides high recognition rate unless there is large in-plane rotation.
