Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF - ORB

"ORB: An efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF":
ORB is basically a fusion of FAST keypoint detector and BRIEF descriptor with many modifications to enhance the performance.
The point is that you have under certain circumstances (at least for commercial-use) to pay to use those algorithm (SIFT, SURF, ..).
ORB comes from "OpenCV Labs", brought up by Ethan Rublee, Vincent Rabaud, Kurt Konolige and Gary R. Bradski and is free to use.
